    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
    <p>
        He deals the cards as a meditation<br>
        And those he plays never suspect<br>
        He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
        He don't play for respect<br>
    </p>
    <p>He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
        The sacred geometry of chance<br>
        The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
        The numbers lead a dance<br>
    </p> 
        
    <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
        I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
        I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
        But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
    </p>
    <p>He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
        He may lay the queen of spades<br>
        He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
        While the memory of it fades<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
        I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
        I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
        But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
        That's not the shape<br>
        The shape of my heart <br>
    </p>
    </p>
