<h2>Lyrics:</h2>
<p>
    You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
    Upon the fields of barley<br>
    You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
    As we walk in fields of gold<br>
</p>
<p>
    So she took her love<br>
    For to gaze a while<br>
    Upon the fields of barley<br>
    In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
    Among the fields of gold<br>
</p>
<p>
    Will you stay with me?<br>
    Will you be my love?<br>
    Upon the fields of barley<br>
    We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
    As we lie in fields of gold<br>
</p>
<p>
    See the west wind move like a lover so<br>
    Upon the fields of barley<br>
    Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth<br>
    Among the fields of gold<br>
</p>
<p>
    I never made promises lightly<br>
    And there have been some that I've broken<br>
    But I swear in the days still left<br>
    We'll walk in fields of gold<br>
    We'll walk in fields of gold<br>
</p>
