<h3>Lyrics:</h3>
<p>
    Every breath you take<br>
    And every move you make<br>
    Every bond you break<br>
    Every step you take<br>
    I'll be watching you<br>
</p>
<p>
    Every single day<br>
    And every word you say<br>
    Every game you play<br>
    Every night you stay<br>
    I'll be watching you<br>
</p>
<p>
    Oh, can't you see<br>
    You belong to me?<br>
    How my poor heart aches<br>
    With every step you take?<br>
</p>
<p>
    Every move you make<br>
    And every vow you break<br>
    Every smile you fake<br>
    Every claim you stake<br>
    I'll be watching you<br>
</p>
<p>
    Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace<br>
    I dream at night, I can only see your face<br>
    I look around, but it's you I can't replace<br>
    I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace<br>
    I keep crying baby, baby please<br>
</p>
